title: Other agents and models
description: How Mjolnir resolves models and adapters for each seat.
---

Mjolnir ships two first-class routes, Codex and Claude, and a
[team](/teams/) decides which one fills each seat. This page covers what
happens underneath — discovery, probing, and model resolution.

Under the hood, Mjolnir selects a model for the primary agent and a default model for
subagents, then chooses a launchable Agent Client Protocol adapter that can
provide each. Mjolnir attaches its `mj-subagents` server — the one the primary
agent calls `create_subagent` through — as a stdio MCP server, the baseline
transport every ACP adapter supports.

## Available routes

| Route | Discovery | Launch notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Existing OpenAI/Codex credentials | Runs the bridge and its bundled compatible Codex CLI through `npx` |
| Claude | Existing Anthropic/Claude credentials | Runs the bridge and its bundled compatible Claude Code executable through `npx` |

Credential discovery checks supported local credential files and environment
variables without logging secret values. Roster resolution launches every
selected adapter, including the npm bridges, before the roster is used. First
launch can require Node.js, npm, network access, and provider authentication.

## Probing

Selected routes are probed concurrently, and roster resolution waits for all
of them before returning. Each probe opens an ACP connection and creates a
disposable session to collect models and session options. Mjolnir does not
persist or reuse ACP capability results between resolutions.

The live DeepSWE v1.1 ranking is separate from adapter capabilities and remains
cached for 24 hours. At roster resolution Mjolnir uses a fresh cache first,
then the live endpoint, then a stale valid cache if refresh fails, and finally
the snapshot bundled with the release. Read
[Storage and network activity](/storage-network/) for paths and endpoints.

`mj models refresh` performs an immediate roster resolution, probes every
enabled adapter, and reports the available model count. Normal startup and
`/new` or `/clear` resolutions perform the same adapter probes automatically.

## Team selection and automatic models

Onboarding, `/mjconfig`, and **Shift+Tab** expose four first-class teams: Codex,
Claude, Codex coder + Claude reviewer, and Claude coder + Codex reviewer. A
team pins the primary route to its coder and the review and subagent routes to
its reviewer. **Claude coder + Codex reviewer** defaults the review and
subagent seats to `gpt-5-6-luna` at `xhigh` effort and selects extended
review; the other teams leave model selection on Auto and preserve the
selected review tier (Quick by default).

Auto uses DeepSWE's program-verified Pass@1 and per-task mean cost. LMArena
human-preference scores are not roster inputs or UI metadata and do not control
Auto. For models with effort-specific rows, only the exact `high` row is
eligible; a model without effort rows uses its strongest default row. A seat's
configured runtime reasoning effort does not rewrite or interpolate the
benchmark score.

| Seat | Controlling objective | Cost and fallback policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | Highest Pass@1 among launchable eligible rows | Mean cost breaks an exact Pass@1 tie; model id breaks a remaining tie. There are no model-specific overrides. |
| Review supervisor | A model distinct from the primary on the DeepSWE quality/cost Pareto frontier | Choose the cheapest model at or above the Sonnet quality floor. Otherwise choose the strongest distinct frontier model cheaper than the primary, then reuse the primary. |
| Default subagent | The same policy as the review supervisor | The same cost, fallback, and distinctness rules as review. |

Before primary ranking, a Team or saved ACP-source constraint limits the
eligible provider. For an unconstrained primary, when both native clients
report subscription tiers and one tier has strictly more capacity, Auto ranks
within that provider so the larger plan can carry the session. Equal or
one-sided detected tiers do not affect ranking.

- Code-level model-specific overrides are not allowed in Auto. An explicit
  user model selection bypasses Auto and is the supported way to pin a product.
- When several adapters offer the selected model, the primary, review, and
  subagent seats apply their independent ACP priority lists. All lists default
  to Codex, then Claude.
- Adapter-advertised models without a leaderboard row (for example Claude's
  `haiku`) are selectable explicitly but do not participate in Auto.

Availability, credentials, advertised capabilities, and the current ranking
can change the result. Auto chooses across launchable ranked models; adapter
priority decides between adapters that provide the selected model. Therefore,
adding another detected provider can change an unconstrained Auto-resolved
seat even though Codex is first in adapter priority. Choose a Team preset to
retain Auto model selection within its assigned provider, and use `/agents` to
record what actually launched.

## Built-ins, platform routes, and the ACP registry

The ACP Servers panel contains the built-in Codex and Claude adapters, the
platform routes (Anvil and Draupnir — the policy switches which one owns the
implicit team), and every agent from the official
[ACP registry](https://agentclientprotocol.com) that ships a distribution for
this platform. Registry agents stay off until explicitly enabled: Auto never
launches one, so enabling is the only way it joins model discovery. `/new`
opens an agent picker listing every registered agent — picking one enables it
and starts the next session with that agent; `/load` uses the same picker to
choose whose sessions to list. Agents distributed as npx/uvx packages launch
directly; binary-distributed agents install on first use. Legacy
`[[acp.servers]]` sections in `config.toml` are ignored on load and dropped on
the next save.

ACP servers are model agents. They are not the same as MCP servers: Mjolnir does
not expose a generic user-facing MCP-server list here. Its internal `mj-subagents`
MCP server exists only to give the primary agent authenticated access to
`create_subagent` and `subagent_cancel`.
