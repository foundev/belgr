//! Single source of truth for Belgr-owned slash commands.
//!
//! Membership lives in three lists: [`SHARED_COMMANDS`] is advertised by both
//! the TUI and the web viewer, [`TUI_ONLY_COMMANDS`] only by the TUI, and
//! [`WEB_ONLY_COMMANDS`] only by the web viewer. Moving a command between
//! surfaces means moving its entry between lists (and giving the new surface
//! a handler for it). Each surface renders the specs into its own command
//! type and keeps ownership of dispatch, of where conditional commands
//! (fork/load/side) sit in its list, and of side-conversation composition.
